# COVID-19_Data-Exploration-Portfolio-Project

Using Google BigQuery, I analyzed Covid-19 data from January 2020 to December 2022 and imported Covid Deaths and Vaccinations tables with the correct data types in the schema. 

🛠️ **Skills used:** data cleaning, aggregate functions, joins, and common table expressions (CTEs), and created views in SQL to facilitate analysis. 

📈 **Data visualizations:** [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yan.rong.bilodeau/viz/COVID-19DataExplorationProject/Covid19DataExploration)

🗂️ **Data source used:** [Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
